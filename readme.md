# food planner app


## potential features
- recipe database
- ingredient database
- ingredients map to real purchaseable products
- shopping list generation
- shopping list optimization
- shopping list metrics
  - efficiency
  - leftover food / waste
- nutrition facts for recipe based on ingredients

## Development plan

1. start with scraping recipes to get some data to start with
2. design a data format to store recipe info


## Legal concerns

- need to keep track of acceptable use for each site
- can only use recepies that allow the ingredient info to be shared
  - minimalistbaker.com allows this for example
