## Development plan

1. start with scraping recipes to get some data to start with
2. design a data format to store recipe info
3. visualize recipe data
   1. try to check for errors on a large scale
4. store recipe data to database
5. create methods to check and update only new or changed recipe data
6. scrape ingredient (product) data
7. design data format to store ingredient data
8. normalize ingredient data from recipes and products so they can be matched up
   1. think about fuzzy matching
   2. how to handle user corrections or user preferences?
9.  


## Legal concerns

- need to keep track of acceptable use for each site
- can only use recepies that allow the ingredient info to be shared
  - minimalistbaker.com allows this for example
